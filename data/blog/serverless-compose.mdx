For a Serverless Framework monorepository with multiple microservices, `Compose` is a vital tool to orchestrate deployments. With a few short steps, you can deploy multiple services with one command and pipe outputs from one service to another via parameters.

## Set Up

Getting started is very straight forward. In the root of your project, add a `serverless-compose.yaml` file

```filepath
project/
  ├── serverless-compose.yaml
  ├── ...
  ├── auth/
  │   ├── serverless.yaml
  │   └── ...
  ├── accounts/
  │   ├── serverless.yaml
  │   └── ...
  └── posts/
      ├── serverless.yaml
      └── ...
```

This file will reference your other services and deploy them via their respective `serverless.yaml` files.

```yaml
# serverless-compose.yaml

services:
  auth:
    path: auth
  accounts:
    path: accounts
  posts:
    path: posts
```

## Deploy

Now that `serverless-compose.yaml` references all your services, you can deploy them with one command from your root project directory:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

This will deploy your services in parallel. But what if you need to use information from one service in another? For example, say you want to reference a user pool ARN from AWS Cognito in another service for HTTP authorization. You would use outputs and parameters!

## Sharing outputs between services

The most useful functionality of the Compose command is passing outputs like ARNs, IDs, or names via [parameters](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/parameters). Below is a brief example of passing an ARN, an environment variable, and two resource IDs.

```yaml
# auth/serverless.yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  ...
  environment:
    USER_POOL_NAME: shownxt-${opt:stage, sls:stage}-auth-pool


functions: ...

resources:
  Resources:
    UserPool:
      Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPool
      Properties: ...
    UserClient:
      Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient
      Properties: ...

  Outputs:
    UserPoolArn:
      Value:
        Fn::GetAtt: UserPool.Arn
    UserPoolName:
      Value: ${self:provider.environment.USER_POOL_NAME}
    UserPoolId:
      Value: !Ref UserPool
    ClientId:
      Value: !Ref UserClient
```

Now let's make sure the `serverless-compose.yaml` file passes these outputs to other services.

```yaml
# serverless-compose.yaml

services:
  auth:
    path: auth
  accounts:
    path: accounts
    params:
      UserPoolArn: ${auth.UserPoolArn}
      UserPoolName: ${auth.UserPoolName}
      UserPoolId: ${auth.UserPoolId}
      ClientId: ${auth.ClientId}
  posts:
    path: posts
```

Now that the `accounts` service references outputs from the `auth` service, `accounts` will not be deployed until `auth` has finished deploying. Any service that depend on another services output will not be deployed until the parent service is deployed.

Then to reference these outputs in another service, for example `accounts`, we can simply access them as parameters.

```yaml
# accounts/serverless.yaml

functions:
  createAccount:
    handler: src/create.handler
    events:
      - cognitoUserPool:
          pool: ${param:UserPoolName}
          trigger: PostConfirmation
          ...

  deleteAccount:
    handler: src/delete.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: accounts/
          method: delete
          authorizer:
            name: Authorizer
            type: COGNITO_USER_POOLS
            arn: ${param:UserPoolArn}
```

Now you know how to share build outputs between your microservices with the Serverless Framework!

summary: 'My plan to rehearse with a rock band... in an apartment!'

I live in an apartment. I play rock and roll. I do not want to upset my neighbors/be evicted. What am I to do?

# A Silent Band Practice

We live in _the future_! We have the technology to play silently thanks to DAWs, audio interfaces, headphones, etc. Let's use these things to practice... silently!

## The Idea

<Image alt="silent practice diagram" src="/static/images/silent-practice/silent-practice-diagram.png" width={1024} height={1024} />

The idea is quite simple. Everyone plugs into an audio interface which is connected to a Mac running a DAW (Logic Pro X for me) and connects their headphones to a headphone amplifier/splitter.

## The Gear

* **Interface**: Focusrtie 18i8
* **Headphone Splitter/Amp**: Mackie HM-4
* **Computer**: Mac Mini M2 Pro
* **DAW**: Logic Pro

### Drums

The drums are connected to the interface via MIDI and use the Superior Drummer 3 plugin (or lighter weight plugin if latency is too high) that is running in Logic Pro.

### Guitar/Bass

The guitar and bass are connected directly to the interface via a 1/4" instrument jack and use an amp simulation plugin.

### Vocals

Again, the vocal microphone is connected directly to the interface. The plugins will likely depend on what the singer wants for playback.

### Logic Pro & Computer

Logic Pro will be running on my Mac Mini M2. Hopefully the latency will be kept to a minimum. The Logic Pro project will ideally be recording the inputs throughout the rehearsal for later playback/demo tapes.
Ideally, a metronome can also be enabled and disabled and we can control the levels for monitoring.


# Part Two...
Part Two - the results - coming soon!
